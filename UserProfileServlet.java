Key Improvements:

* **Parameterized Queries (PreparedStatements):**  This is the most crucial change.  Using `PreparedStatement` prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities (both first-order and second-order) because user-supplied input is treated as data, not as part of the SQL command.
* **Escaping for Second-Order Injection:** Although `PreparedStatement` is the primary defense, we also escape the user input using `StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava()` before storing it in the database. This provides an additional layer of security, especially important for data that might be later used in dynamic SQL construction in other parts of the application (the essence of second-order injection).
* **Consistent Sanitization:**  The code now consistently sanitizes `userId` *before* it's used in both the `INSERT` and the `SELECT` statements.  This is essential to prevent second-order vulnerabilities.
* **Try-with-resources:** Ensures that database resources (connections, prepared statements, result sets) are closed properly, even in case of exceptions.
* **Generic Error Message:**  Avoids revealing detailed SQL error information to the user, which could be exploited by attackers.


**Explanation of Second-Order Injection and Mitigation**

Second-order SQL injection occurs when an application stores unsanitized user input in a database, and then later uses that stored data to construct a dynamic SQL query. Even if the initial storage doesn't lead to an immediate vulnerability, the stored malicious data can be "triggered" later when used to build another query.


By using `PreparedStatement` and escaping the data before storage, this code completely mitigates the second-order SQL injection vulnerability. The escaping ensures that any potentially harmful characters are neutralized before they are stored in the database, making them harmless even if later used in dynamic SQL construction.  The `PreparedStatement`  provides the robust, primary defense by separating user-supplied data from the SQL command structure itself.


This revised code is much more secure and follows best practices for preventing SQL injection.  Remember to include the `commons-text` dependency in your project (e.g., in your `pom.xml` if you are using Maven) to use `StringEscapeUtils`.
